# native_lua

First, install cmake.
Then, follow:
```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cp ../run.sh ./
    ./run.sh
```

You can do some practice to test lua c api by this project easily.
Add some code in main.cpp and do test by run.sh in build directory.

Sometimes, I just want a clean lua test environment to test some lua api feature. At first, I created a project by eclipse about 2 years ago. Recently, I need test for something again but find eclipse is not easy, so I try the cmake, start a clean project.
So enjoy yourself.
