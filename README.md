# native_lua

Run project
modify main.cpp for test
```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cp ../run.sh ./
    ./run.sh
```

You can do some practice to test lua c api by this project easily.
Add some code in main.cpp and do you test by run.sh in build directory.

Sometimes, I just want a clean lua test environment for me to test some lua api feature. The first time, I use eclipse to create a project for test. Recently, I find eclipse is not easy set for c language, so I change to cmake to start a clean project and it is great for me to write test.
So enjoy yourself.
